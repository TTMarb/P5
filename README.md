# P5 - UAS FOR AVALANCHE RESCUE

## About the project 
The project is a UAS flight pattern control system for assisting emergency personnel in performing an avalanche rescue. The flight pattern is divided into two search stages. Firstly, a uniform area search locates a transceiver beacon within approx. 20 m. Next, a control feedback pattern algorithm reaches the beacon within 3 m. The control system runs on a DJI Manifold 1 for the DJI M100 drone. The prototype features an specialized antenna configuration for locating the signal beacon. The control system uses Onboard SDK API from DJI for the control software.
