fmem 1.6.0

This repo is was originally a github mirror of the original fmem module.
Later this repo became a maintained version of fmem to account for a changing Linux kernel.
Bug reports and patches welcome.

This module creates /dev/fmem device,
that can be used for dumping physical memory,
without limits of /dev/mem (1MB/1GB, depending on distribution)
  
Tested on i386 and x64, feel free to test it on 
different architectures. (and send report please)
 
Cloned from linux/drivers/char/mem.c 
(so GPL license apply)

Original name of this tool was fdump, 
which was conflict with already existing tool,
so name was changed to fmem

Usage:

$ make

# ./run.sh

# dd if=/dev/fmem of=... bs=1MB count=... 

-----
BUGS: if you do something like # dd if=/dev/fmem of=dump 
      dd will never stop, even if there is no more physical RAM
      on the system. This is more a feature, because Linux kernel
      don't have stable API, and detection of mapped areas can be 
      tricky on older kernels. Because primary usage for fmem is 
      memory forensic, I think it is safer to specify 
      amount of RAM by hand.
